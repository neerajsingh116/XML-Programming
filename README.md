# XML-Programming
This Codes are performed in my Lab.
[Aim- Create an xml document for representing the structure of the Book.
Software Requirement – The software requirement include a text editor (notepad++) and Web Browser.  
-Hardware Requirements - Hardware Interface:
-a)Intel® Core ™  i5-6006U CPU, Processor speed : 2.00GHz
-b)   Minimum RAM requirement for proper functioning is 8 GB.
Methodology-
1.)	XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.
2.)	A markup language is used to provide information about a document.
3.)	Tags are added to the document to provide the extra information.
4.)	Root Element − An XML document can have only one root element.

5.)	UTF means Unicode Transformation Format and 8 means it uses 8-bit blocks to represent a character. This is also known as XML prolog.
6.)	XML Prolog is the component added in the beginning of an XML document.
7.)	Comments in xml document- < !- - This is comment - ->
8.)	Basic rules of xml document-
•	The XML declaration is case sensitive and must begin with "<?xml>" where "xml" is written in lower-case.
•	If document contains XML declaration, then it strictly needs to be the first statement of the XML document.
•	All xml elements must have a closing tag.
•	Xml attribute values must always be in quoted.

Conclusion-   The resultant will be the creation of the xml document which can be explored or executed with the help of internet browser.
